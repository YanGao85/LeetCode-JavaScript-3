# 657. Judge Route Circle

### Example
```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```
### Example 2
```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

### Question 
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0).   
Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.  
  
The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character.  
The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down).  
The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.  

### 翻譯 
最初, 有個機器人在位置 (0, 0).
給他了一連串的動作之後, 判斷這機器人會不會繞一圈, 也就是回到原點.  
  
動作的序列將會是字串, 每個字元代表一個動作.
有效的動作為R (往右), L (往左), U (往上)和 D (往下).  
輸出結果必須是 ture 或是 false, 代表這機器人有沒有繞一圈.
