# 771. Jewels and Stones

### Example
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```
### Example 2
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

### Problem 
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,  
and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.  
  
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters.  
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

### 翻譯 
#### Problem 
有一字串 J 代表寶石的種類, 字串 S 代表你擁有的石頭.  
字串 S 的每一個字元都代表著你有的一個那種石頭.  
你想要知道你的石頭裡有幾個是寶石.  
  
字串 J 的每個字母都保證不同, 而且 J 與 S 的每個字元都保證是字母.  
字母有區分大小寫, 所以 "a" 被認定為與 "A" 是不同類型的石頭.
