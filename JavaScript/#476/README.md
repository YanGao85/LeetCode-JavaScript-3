# 476. Number Complement

### Problem

Given a positive integer, output its complement number.  
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

### Note

1.  The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2.  You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

### Example 1

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

#### Problem 問題

給定一個正整數, 輸出其補數.  
補數的定義是翻轉其二進制數的每個代表位元.

#### Note

1.  給定的整數保證符合在 32 位元有號數的範圍內.
2.  你可以在整數的二進制表示裡假設其沒有前面的 0 位元.
