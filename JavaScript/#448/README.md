## Origin

### Question

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ *n* (_n_ = size of array),  
some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, *n*] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(_n_) runtime?  
You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

### Example

```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```
