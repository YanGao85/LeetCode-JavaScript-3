# 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

### Question 
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue.  
Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`,  
where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

### Note  
 - The number of people is less than `1,100`.

### Example 1
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

#### Question
假設有一個隨機的人們排隊的列表.  
每個人都用一對整數 `(h, k)` 來描述,  
`h` 代表著那人的身高, 而 `k` 則是身高高於或等於 `h` 的人在他前面的數量.  
寫出一個算法來重建這個隊列. 

#### Note 
 - 人數小於 `1,100`
